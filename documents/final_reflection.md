# Final Thesis Reflection

### This document is a collection of my final thoughts I have in regards to my thesis research over the last year.

Writing this thesis was very uniquely special experience for me. In my junior year at Brandeis I was exposed to several state of the art computer science papers in my Deep Learning and Computer Vision classes in which I was either implementing the algorithms described in papers or presenting reviews of their research. Being able to be on the research and paper writing side of things was a new and interesting perspective to take.

I have always struggled a lot with long-term unstructured tasks (much like this one) and I knew going into this that it would be quite challenging for me. I have learned a lot about planning and scheduling these things including how to break up large tasks into many smaller concrete tasks with deadlines. The biggest thing about I learned from this project comes how self-reliant one must be while doing research of this type as opposed to standard course work. There aren't people who know the solution to your problem who can help when you get stuck and I realized how much progress can be made on seemingly hopeless tasks with continued and dedicated work.

There are several moments throughout this process where it feels easier to just give up but I learned to push through those moments and I have managed to complete my thesis research.

I am incredibly proud of the research and work I have produced at the end of this project. I am thankful for all the lessons and knowledge I have learned and I hope they serve me well in my professional endeavors post-graduation.

I would like to thank Prof. Pito Salas once again for his continued advising and support without which my research would not have been possible. Additionally I would like to thank Prof. Pengyu Hong for his advice and interest in my research throughout the last year.

I am looking forward to the opportunity to share my research with the thesis defense panel on May 4th, 2022.
